## Cofe Shop

Cofe Shop is a MVC .Net application that I created to learn more about full stack dev and showcase a "store" like application.

Goal: 
- Make a MVC .Net app like Dunkin Donuts/Starbucks.
- Allow users to order a drink
- "Manager view" to showcase the "backend".
- Understand how to use a object mapper (EF)

Subgoals:
- Make it pretty enough (next app will be front end focused)
- Be comfy with models, views, and controller 
  - how they pass data, query, sort data, and make new objects
- have fun?
